Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. 

Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Definition:

Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions.
job_listings Table:

job_listings Example Input:

job_id	company_id title	          description
248	    827      	Business Analyst	Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organizations.
149	    845	      Business Analyst	Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organizations.
945	    345	      Data Analyst	    Data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a business's customers and ways the data can be used to solve problems.
164	    345	      Data Analyst	    Data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a business's customers and ways the data can be used to solve problems.
172	    244	      Data Engineer	    Data engineer works in a variety of settings to build systems that collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information for data scientists and business analysts to interpret.


Step 1: Identify companies with duplicate job listings
The first step is to determine which companies have posted duplicate job listings with the same title and description. 
We can do so by utilizing the COUNT() aggregate function to calculate the number of job_id entries grouped by company_id, title, and description.

SELECT 
  company_id, 
  title, 
  description, 
  COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
FROM job_listings
GROUP BY company_id, title, description;

company_id	title	        description	              job_count
827	    Data Scientist	Data scientist uses data to 2
244	    Data Engineer	  Data engineer works in...   1
845	    Business Analyst	Business analyst evaluates	1
244	    Software Engineer	Software engineers design 	2
345	    Data Analyst	  Data analyst reviews data	    2

Step 2: Filter for companies with duplicate job listings
Next, we can proceed to filter the previous query by converting it into a Common Table Expression (CTE) and selecting only the rows where 
the job_count is greater than 1, indicating the presence of duplicate job listings.
To obtain a count of unique companies, we apply the DISTINCT keyword on the company_id column.

WITH job_count_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY company_id, title, description
)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM job_count_cte
WHERE job_count > 1;

Example Output:

duplicate_companies
1

Explanation:

There is one company ID 345 that posted duplicate job listings. The duplicate listings, IDs 945 and 164 have identical titles and descriptions.
